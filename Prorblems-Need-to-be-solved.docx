1. Park Ranger Patrol Route Problem:
You are a park ranger and you want to plan the most efficient route for your daily patrol. Your patrol covers several parks in a park system. You want to visit each park once and return to your starting park.

Given a list of parks and the distances between each pair of parks, write a program to calculate the shortest route that visits every park exactly once and returns to the starting park.

Input:

A list of parks [(A, B, C, ...)]
A matrix of distances between each pair of parks [(AB, AC, AD, ...), (BA, BC, BD, ...), ...]
Output:

The shortest route visiting each park once and returning to the starting park.
Example:
Input: Parks = [A, B, C, D]
Distances = [[0, 10, 20, 30], [10, 0, 15, 25], [20, 15, 0, 20], [30, 25, 20, 0]]
Output: A -> B -> C -> D -> A (total distance = 90)

2. Weekly Menu Planning Problem:
You are a chef and you want to plan a weekly menu for your restaurant. You have a list of ingredients and their availability and shelf life. You want to create a weekly menu that uses the ingredients before they go bad, and maximizes the use of ingredients.

Given a list of ingredients, their availability, and their shelf life, write a program to generate a weekly menu for your restaurant.

Input:

A list of ingredients [(Ingredient 1, Ingredient 2, ...)]
A list of the availability of each ingredient [(Ingredient 1 Availability, Ingredient 2 Availability, ...)]
A list of the shelf life of each ingredient [(Ingredient 1 Shelf Life, Ingredient 2 Shelf Life, ...)]
Output:

A weekly menu using the ingredients and maximizing their use.
Example:
Input: Ingredients = [Tomatoes, Lettuce, Carrots, Chicken]
Availability = [100, 50, 75, 200]
Shelf Life = [5, 7, 10, 3]
Output: Monday: Salad with Tomatoes, Lettuce, and Carrots
Tuesday: Chicken stir-fry with Tomatoes, Carrots
Wednesday: Chicken and Carrot wrap with Lettuce
Thursday: Tomato soup with Chicken
Friday: Carrot soup with Lettuce
Saturday: Chicken and Vegetable skewers with Tomatoes and Carrots

Note: This problem can have multiple solutions depending on the constraints and priorities set by the chef.



3. Package Delivery Problem:
You are a delivery person and you have several packages to deliver to different locations. You want to plan the most efficient route to deliver all the packages.

Given a list of delivery locations, write a program to calculate the shortest route to deliver all the packages.

Input:

A list of delivery locations [(Location 1, Location 2, ...)]
A matrix of distances between each pair of locations [(Location 1 to Location 2, Location 1 to Location 3, ...), (Location 2 to Location 1, Location 2 to Location 3, ...), ...]
Output:

The shortest route to deliver all the packages.
Example:
Input: Locations = [A, B, C, D, E]
Distances = [[0, 10, 20, 30, 40], [10, 0, 15, 25, 35], [20, 15, 0, 20, 30], [30, 25, 20, 0, 10], [40, 35, 30, 10, 0]]
Output: A -> C -> B -> D -> E -> A (total distance = 120)


4. Resource Allocation Problem:
A company has a set of projects and a set of resources. Each project requires a certain amount of each resource, and each resource has a limited availability. The goal is to allocate resources to projects in a way that maximizes the total amount of work done.

Given the resources and projects available, write a program to determine the optimal allocation of resources to projects.

Input:

A list of projects [(Project 1, Resource 1 needed, Resource 2 needed, ...), (Project 2, Resource 1 needed, Resource 2 needed, ...), ...]
A list of resources [(Resource 1, Total available), (Resource 2, Total available), ...]
Output:

The optimal allocation of resources to projects.
Example:
Input: Projects = [ (P1, 10, 20, 30), (P2, 20, 15, 25), (P3, 5, 10, 15) ]
Resources = [ (R1, 40), (R2, 50), (R3, 60) ]
Output: P1 receives 30 units of R1, 20 units of R2, and 30 units of R3.
P2 receives 10 units of R1, 15 units of R2, and 25 units of R3.
P3 receives 0 units of R1, 20 units of R2, and 15 units of R3.


5. Travel Planning Problem:
You are planning a trip and want to visit several cities in the most efficient order. You want to minimize the total travel time while ensuring that you visit all the cities.

Given a list of cities and the travel time between each pair of cities, write a program to calculate the most efficient route to visit all the cities.

Input:

A list of cities [(City 1, City 2, ...)]
A matrix of travel times between each pair of cities [(City 1 to City 2, City 1 to City 3, ...), (City 2 to City 1, City 2 to City 3, ...), ...]
Output:

The most efficient route to visit all the cities.
Example:
Input: Cities = [A, B, C, D, E]
Travel times = [[0, 10, 20, 30, 40], [10, 0, 15, 25, 35], [20, 15, 0, 20, 30], [30, 25, 20, 0, 10], [40, 35, 30, 10, 0]]
Output: A -> C -> B -> D -> E (total travel time = 110)
